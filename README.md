# Overview
I chose this project to practice writing dynamic web applications with React.js framework.
This project is a simple calculator web app. The calculator is fully functional and interactive. It 
takes an input from a user and has the same functionalities as the default calculators 
that are pre-installed on our devices. The calculator also has a clear and delete functions 
and works on different screen sizes.
To start the programm:
-nmp run start VS code command. This command will start a local server on your machine.

There are three components that generated automatically: square, input field, and calculator that combines all the components
